## compare.py
Signature verification based on OpenCV libraries. It uses SIFT image feature detection algorithm. The signature verification is built upon image feature recognition and a comparison of the captured feature 

```
$ python compare.py -b sign-1.jpg -c sign-2.jpg
```

## Sample output
![sample image](sample.png) 

## test_akaze.py
Image feature detection using AKAZE algorithm

```
$ python test_akaze.py
```
